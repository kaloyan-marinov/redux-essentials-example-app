# Redux Essentials Tutorial Example

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Notes

## Creating the Posts Slice

1. The first step is to create a new Redux "slice" that will contain the data for our posts. Once we have that data in the Redux store, we can create the React components to show that data on the page.

## Showing the Posts List

1. Now that we have some posts in our store, we can create a React component that shows the list of posts.

## Adding New Posts

1. We'll create the empty form first and add it to the page.
2. Then, we'll connect the form to our Redux store so that new posts are added when we click the "Save Post" button.

## Users and Posts

1. Real applications will probably have many different slices of state, and several different "feature folders" for the Redux logic and React components.
2. You can't have a "social media" app if there aren't any other people involved. Let's add the ability to keep track of a list of users in our app, and update the post-related functionality to make use of that data.
3. In a real app, we'd have some sort of a `state.currentUser` field that keeps track of the current logged-in user, and use that information whenever they add a post.
